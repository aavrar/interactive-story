# Interactive Storytelling Engine - Project Progress

## Overall Goal

To build a text-based interactive storytelling engine inspired by Zork, with ML-powered narrative branching, implemented as a web-based Python project using FastAPI for the backend and a simple React or CLI frontend.

## Project Tasks

### 1. Core Engine (CORE)
- [x] 1.1 FastAPI backend setup (CORE-1.1)
- [x] 1.2 StoryEngine class with basic game logic (CORE-1.2)
- [x] 1.3 Loading story scenes from `story.json` (CORE-1.3)
- [x] 1.4 Basic command processing (`go`, `take`, `drop`, `use`) (CORE-1.4)
- [x] 1.5 Inventory tracking (CORE-1.5)
- [x] 1.6 Improved story.json structure (metadata, items, flags) (CORE-1.6)
- [x] 1.7 Story editor CLI (add/edit scenes) (CORE-1.7)
- [x] 1.8 Item properties and effects (damage, weight) (CORE-1.11)
- [x] 1.9 Flag-based conditions for choices and scene descriptions (CORE-1.12)
- [x] 1.10 Saving and loading game state (CORE-1.13)
- [ ] 1.11 Consider using a database (SQLite) for larger stories (CORE-1.14)

    #### Core Engine Modules
    - `core/models.py`: Defines the Pydantic models.
    - `core/engine.py`: Contains the StoryEngine class.

### 2. Command Line Interface (CLI)
- [x] 2.1 Basic CLI interface (CLI-2.1)
- [x] 2.2 Save and load commands (CLI-2.2)

### 3. API (API)
- [x] 3.1 FastAPI endpoints for scene and command processing (API-3.1)

    #### API Modules
    - `api.py`: Defines the FastAPI application and endpoints.

### 4. Story Editor (EDITOR)
- [x] 4.1 Basic CLI story editor (EDITOR-4.1)
- [x] 4.2 Add condition field to story editor (EDITOR-4.2)

### 5. Front End (FRONT)
- [x] 5.1 Develop a React-based web frontend (FRONT-5.1)
    - [x] 5.1.1 Styling: The frontend currently has minimal styling (FRONT-5.1.1)
    - [x] 5.1.2 Dynamic Updates: The frontend should dynamically update the scene when the player takes an action (FRONT-5.1.2)
    - [x] 5.1.3 Error Handling: Implement more robust error handling in the frontend (FRONT-5.1.3)
    - [x] 5.1.4 User Interface: Improve the user interface to be more user-friendly (FRONT-5.1.4)

### 6. ML Integration (ML)
- [ ] 6.1 Integrate an ML classifier to suggest narrative branches (ML-6.1)
    - [ ] 6.1.1 Emotion classification (ML-6.1.1)
    - [ ] 6.1.2 Context-aware branch suggestion (ML-6.1.2)

## Notes

- This document will be updated regularly to reflect the current state of the project.
- "Implemented" features are marked with [x].
- "Planned" features are subject to change based on project needs and priorities.
- Each task and sub-task has a unique identifier (e.g., CORE-1.1, EDIT-2.5) for easy reference.

**Legend:**

- [x] - Completed
- [ ] - To Do
- [~] - In Progress

**Next Steps:**

Now that the core functionality is working, the next steps are to:

1.  **Thoroughly Test the Game**: Play through the game from start to finish, testing all the commands, choices, and conditions. This will help identify any remaining bugs or areas for improvement.
2.  **Consider Database Implementation (CORE-1.14)**: Revisit the idea of using a database (SQLite) to store the story data. This will be necessary for larger stories.
3.  **Implement ML Integration (ML-6.1)**: Start working on the ML integration to suggest narrative branches.
